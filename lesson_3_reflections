When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to use a remote repository to keep your project secure.  It is also useful if multiple people are working on the project from different computers.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A feature may not be complete at the time you complete the local commit. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are used to make copies of a repository on the GitHub server that will be saved in your profile.  Clones are used to make a copy from somewwhere to your computer.  Branches are used to make new commits to try out new features.  


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

the benefit of having the origin/master file is that you know the last state of what was going on on the server.  


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

You could collaborate with out github by using another cloud based program that allows multiple users to edit the same document, or by making multiple copies of th same document and having each person work on a different part.  it would be more difficult to get rid of bugs and track changes without git.
